# Predicting Banknote Authenticity
For this project, I use unsupervised learning techniques to predict banknote authenticity. The dataset consists of features derived from wavelet analysis of banknote images.

## Files Included
* **Predicting_Banknote_Authenticity.ipynb:** Notebook containing data analysis and unsupervised learning models.
* **helpers.py:** Python script with helper methods and constants used by the above notebook.
